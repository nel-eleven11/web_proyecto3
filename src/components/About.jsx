                    <p class="text-justify">
                        I am a 20 years old and  3rd year student studying Computer Science and Information Technology Engineering in Guatemala. 
                        Throughout my academic training, I have acquired solid knowledge in various programming 
                        languages and technological tools. I am excited to work on challenging projects that allow me 
                        to apply and expand my technical skills, and I am always looking for new opportunities to 
                        learn and grow professionally. I am committed to excellence and innovation, and my goal is to 
                        contribute meaningfully to the field of technology.
